##Projects

###Semantic Neural Model for Face Recognition from Sketch
•	Developed a semantic neural model for simultaneous face caricature synthesis and recognition.
•	Integrated approach bridging the gap between face caricature synthesis and recognition in law enforcement applications.
•	Implemented controlled conditions (frontal pose, standard lighting, neutral expression) for optimal model performance.
•	Divided facial areas into overlapping patches for comprehensive learning, determining local face structures for synthesis and recognition.
